# Random-General-Tree-Generator
- This Eclipse repository contains a Java project that constructs a random general tree according to the requested parameters from user and saves it in a text file in JSON array format.
- It is implemented in Java 1.8 with Eclipse.
- Import the project in Eclipse and run directly.
- When you run the code, you are going to be asked to enter node count, maximum branching factor, minimum key size, and maximum key size, respectively.
	- Node count corresponds to the number of nodes to be created.
	- Maximum branching factor corresponds to the maximum child count that a node can have.
	- Minimum and maximum key sizes are the minimum and maximum length values of the keys in each node.
- The code is not error-free, i.e., all the errors are not checked. There might be exceptions and unexpected situations during the execution. So, you may have to manipulate the source code according to your needs.
- When the tree construction is finished, it is saved in the file named "out.txt" in JSON array format.
